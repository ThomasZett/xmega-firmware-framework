This project exists to act as a framework for creating basic USB-capable firmware for the xmega32a4u using the awesome [USB-XMEGA](https://github.com/nonolith/USB-XMEGA) stack by [Kevin Mehall](https://github.com/kevinmehall).

I was tired of copying the same half-dozen files every time I worked on a new project, so I created this repository to act as a template for making stuff happen. 

To use this project, you will need to modify ".VendorID" and ".ProductID" on lines 56 and 57 of Descriptors.h to match your end device. This change will also need to be reflected in the makefile definition of "make update."

Additionally, to accurately reflect the branding of your hardware, you will need to modify all instances of "USB_Descriptor_String_t."
